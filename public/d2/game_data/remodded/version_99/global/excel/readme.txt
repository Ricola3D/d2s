  > Charm shouldn't have Equiv2=poti
  > Helm key should be "helm" not "merc", plus it should have Equiv1=armo, not poti
  > Weapon shouldn't have Equiv1=gold
  > Any Armor should have Equiv1=merc not gold
  > Merc Equip
    > Key should be "merc" not "helm"
    > It shouldn't have Equiv1=armo nor Equip2=merc. It would result in duplicates.
